  <h2>Future Goals</h2>
  <p class = "text">In isolation, we had sound effects working on this system, including lobby music, and sound effects for shooting, reloading, winning, losing and getting shot. However, sound because difficult to implement when all features were merged together. These sound effects can be on the github repo. In the future, this cuold could be turned into a battle royale. Because GPS support exists, you could place different items and power ups periodically across a map. We would also like
    to add support for different kinds of weapons with different kinds of properties (more ammo, different firerate, etc). Going forward, we think that the lasers should be replaced with IR sensors for a stronger signal. Most laser tag systems do this and merely use lasers for visual feedback. This would make it easier to hit the transistor recievers. Because of the relatively weak signal generated by the laser, we were never able to distinguish between players with PWM frequency signals.
    Once this is done then different players could have different points, and thus a leaderboard. Additionally, we would like to add different game mode support such as team mode or free for all. For these respective modes, we would like to add communication channels (walkie talkies) to create a complete laser tag system.
