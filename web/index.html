  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p class = "text">Lazer Tag is a game developed over the past few weeks that uses most of the techniques we learned in <a href="https://iesc.io/608/S19">6.08</a>. Our Lazer tag is a variation of the regular laser tag game with the addition of a smartphone application and wifi connectedness within the game.

Players start off in any location and ready up using their custom vest and gun hardware and get put into a game. In the app every player can see the locations of all the players anonymously to choose where or who to target next. The application also has all the game values for each player like lives and bullets to have an accurate representation of the game.

The way for a player to win is to be the last man standing. For a player to “kill” another player thy have to use their own gun to take away the other players last life. We differentiate who killed who through encoding information through the laser used by each player. The last player with any lives is crowned the winner.
