  <img src="images/app-screenshot1.png"><p>getAllPlayersInGame sends the "getPlayers" request to the server and returns a dictionary of {username: [health, bullets, lat, lon]}. This data is stored locally and used to populate the UITable, and reloaded with the reloadWithoutScroll() function. getAllPlayersInGame() is called every 0.5 seconds.</p>
  <img src="images/app-screenshot2.png"><p>This is the GPS code. locationManager 'didUpdateLocations' is called whenever the iPhone recieves new GPS data; every time this happens, the app launches a 'GPSUpdate' post request updating that particular player's GPS location; additionally the function invokes the updateLocationRequest method which
    makes a GET request, getting the locations of all the players in the game. This information is displayed in the GoogleMapViewController as markers with annotated names, so that you can see where every player is.
  <h3>  clear.py </h3>
  <p> Clears all values in a database for debugging </p>
